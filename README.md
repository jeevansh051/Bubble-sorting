# Bubble-sorting
A basic cpp code while describing bubble sorting

## Theory
- Bubble Sort is the simplest of the sorting techniques. In the bubble sort technique, each of the elements in the list is compared to its adjacent element. Thus if there are n elements in list A, then A[0] is compared to A[1], A[1] is compared to A[2] and so on. After comparing if the first element is greater than the second, the two elements are swapped then.

### Algorithm
- Step 1: For i = 0 to N-1 repeat Step 2

- Step 2: For J = i + 1 to N â€“ I repeat

- Step 3: if A[J] > A[i] Swap A[J] and A[i] [End of Inner for loop] [End if Outer for loop]

- Step 4: Exit

Array entirely sorted.

### outcomes:
this code helps us in bubble sorting the input in greater or lesser than order.
